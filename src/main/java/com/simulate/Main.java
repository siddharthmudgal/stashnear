/**
 * PROBLEM STATEMENT :
 * Your input consists of a list of one one-time and/or one monthly deposit plan (maximum two deposit plans total),
 * as well as a list of fund deposits for a particular customer. When you design the data structures, each deposit plan
 * must at least contain the portfolio as well as the absolute amount of money to allocate to that portfolio,
 * and fund deposits must at least contain an absolute money amount deposited. Please build a method that can be called
 * with the described input of both one-time and monthly deposit plans as well as a list of fund deposits, that returns
 * the allocation of funds amongst the customerâ€™s portfolios. Keep in mind that all deposits must be distributed fully.
 *
 * SOLUTION :
 * 1. Main.java -> Takes input from a file and reconstructs the string input to objects
 * 2. com.stashaway.controllers -> Holds controllers for various actions
 *  a. deposit -> process the deposit amount against a portfolio for a customer
 *  b. deposit_plan -> processes an entire deposit plan of a customer; deposit by deposit
 *  c. deposit_command_generator -> creates a list of deposit commands to be executed. List of commands allows the
 *      software to use buses / async tasks to process individual transactions
 *  d. customer_reference_resolver -> controller that stores and retrieves customer information. Currently this
 *      controller stores and generates dummy users and portfolios due to absence of database.
 * 3. enums -> Holds various enums required by the software
 * 4. pojo -> holds data models / data structures for representing relations and values
 * 5. resources/inputFile.txt -> holds input for Main.java.
 *
 * ASSUMPTIONS :
 * 1. Customer reference ID is not part of input. However, the code is designed such that with minimum modifications it
 * can start processing deposit plans for multiple customers with multiple deposit plans
 * 2. No pre-existing customers exist and their profiles are created at runtime. I have used input to generate a
 * customer profile.
 * 3. Input format specifications
 *
 * INTERESTING FEATURES :
 * 1. The code can handle more than just a pair of deposit plans
 * 2. With a small modification, the code can handle multiple deposit plans / deposits and customers
 * 3. Deposit_command_generator would allow async execution of deposits. In a real case scenario this can be bundled
 * with a message bus. This would allow an independent microservice to process deposits.
 *
 * PLEASE NOTE :
 * 1. Logging functionality is not implemented in this source currently. Not sure, if it was part of the scope of this
 * task
 * 2. This snippet is used to express my ability to understand data structure and design. There could be edge cases
 * that I haven't thought through.
